# Below are some key commands to utilize cron and interact with a crontab:
# - To load a crontab from a file: crontab SCRIPTNAME
# - To view the current crontab: crontab -l
# - To directly edit the current crontab: crontab -e

* 7-19 * * 1-5 PROJECTPATH/getimg.sh CAMERANAME 10
* 7-19 * * 1-5 PROJECTPATH/getimg.sh 2 10
* 7-19 * * 1-5 PROJECTPATH/getimg.sh 3 10
* 7-19 * * 1-5 PROJECTPATH/getimg.sh 5 10
* 7-19 * * 1-5 touch PROJECTPATH/cron_running_verification.txt
1 20 * * 1-5 PROJECTPATH/daily_email.sh >& /dev/null

# The first few characters on each line of a crontab designate the specific timing of when the shell command on that line should be executed. For the first five lines in listing 2, these correspond to:
# - every minute (*)
# - 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (7-19)
# - every day of the month (*)
# - every month (*)
# - Monday-Friday (1-5)

# The script also touches a file to indicate it's working via the time stamp (which can be utilized as a manual status check and to debug any issues during initial setup and configuration). 
# In order to utilize this status check, make a file "cron-running-verification.txt" and put something like this in the contents: 
# "Check the timestamp on this file to verify the crontab is running. It should be updating every minute the crontab is active."

# The last line executes the Daily Email script once at 8:01 p.m. on Monday-Friday.
